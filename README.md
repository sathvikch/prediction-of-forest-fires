# prediction-of-forest-fires
using  python and machine learning.


A detailed analysis of forest fire prediction using various 
machine learning models, including Neural Network, Support Vector Regression 
(SVR), Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression. The study focuses on 
predicting the burnt area of forest fires by incorporating meteorological factors such 
as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, along with temporal 
factors like the month and day of the year. Each model's performance is evaluated 
based on metrics such as total loss in vegetation, mean accuracy, and distance 
covered. Additionally, feature importance analysis and visualizations are included to 
identify key factors influencing forest fire occurrence. The findings highlight the 
effectiveness of these models in predicting forest fire severity, with particular 
emphasis on the superior performance of the Random Forest Regressor and Neural 
Network models. These insights are crucial for enhancing forest fire prediction and 
facilitating effective disaster management strategies
